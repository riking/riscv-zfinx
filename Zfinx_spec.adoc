= `Zfinx` Specification

[[Heading]]
== Overview

Zfinx is an extension which changes all existing and future floating point extensions which use the `F` floating point registers, so that instead they use the `X` registers. Hence the name `F-in-X`. This does not affect floating point instructions which are implemented as part of the Vector (`v`) extension (except where these instructions attempt to access scalar F registers). `Zfinx` additionally modifies the RISCV base architecture to remove all floating point load (e.g. `FLW`) store (e.g. `FSW`) and register move (e.g. `FMV.X.W`) encodings as the integer versions of these are required instead.

On a `Zfinx` core the assembler syntax of floating point instructions changes so that they only refer to `X` registers. Therefore on an RV32F core this is legal syntax:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
FLW     fa4, 12(sp)        //load floating point data
FMADD.S fa1, fa2, fa3, fa4 //floating point arithmetic for RV32F
----

On a `Zfinx` core, this syntax must be used as the `F` registers are not implemented, and `FLW` is not a supported instruction.

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
LW      a4, 12(sp)     //load integer data
FMADD.S a1, a2, a3, a4 //floating point arithmetic for RV32F Zfinx
----

Note that only the assembler syntax differs between the two `FMADD.S` instructions, the encoding is the same.

Zfinx may be used with any extensions which uses `F` registers. The number of integer registers does not affect `Zfinx` (`I` or `E` extensions)
although the relative sizes of `XLEN` and `FLEN` do affect the implementation.

|================================================================

Note :

. `RV32FD [Zfh] Zfinx` is *significantly* more complex than the other cases, as it requires register pairs
. `Zfh` is taken as an example of a 16-bit floating point format, the actual format in use doesn't effect the `Zfinx` handling, only the bit-width is important

RV128 and the `Q` extension are not covered by this specification, but it is simple to extend this specification to include them.

[[semantics]]
== Semantic Differences

The NaN-boxing behaviour of floating point arithmetic instructions is modified to suppress checking of sources only.

There are no other semantic differences for floating point instruction behaviour between a `Zfinx` and a `non-Zfinx` core.


[[Heading]]
== Discovery

If `Zfinx` is specified then the compiler will have the following *#define* set

`__riscv_zfinx`

So software can use this to choose between `Zfinx` or normal versions of floating point code.

Privileged code can detect whether `Zfinx` is implemented by checking if:

. `mstatus.FS` is hardwired to zero, and

. `misa.F` is 1 at reset, or is writeable


Non-privileged code can detect whether `Zfinx` is implemented as follows.

[source,sourceCode,text]
----

li a0, 0 # set a0 to zero

#ifdef __riscv_zfinx

fneg.s a0, a0 # this will invert a0

#else

fneg.s fa0, fa0 # this will invert fa0

#endif

----


If a0 is non-zero then it’s a `Zfinx` core, otherwise it’s a *non-Zfinx* core. Both branches result in the *same encoding*, but the assembly syntax is different for each variant

[[mstatus.fs]]
== mstatus.fs

For `Zfinx` cores `mstatus.fs` is hardwired to zero, because all the integer registers already form part of the current context. Note however that `fcsr` needs to be saved and restored. This gives a performance advantage when saving/restoring contexts.

Unlike *non-Zfinx* cores, floating point instructions and `fcsr` accesses do not trap if `mstatus.fs`=0.

[[rv32fd-zfh-zfinx-register-pair-handling]]
== Register pair handling for XLEN < FLEN

For `RV32D`, all D-extension instructions which are implemented with `Zfinx` will access register pairs:

. The specified register must be even, odd registers will cause an illegal instruction exception
. Even registers will cause an even/odd pair to be accessed
.. Accessing Xn will cause the {Xn+1, Xn} pair to be accessed. For example if n = 2
... X2 is the least significant half (bits [31:0]) for little endian mode
... X3 the most significant half (bits [63:32]) for little endian mode
.. For big endian mode the register mapping is reversed, so X2 is the most significant half, and X3 is the least significant half.
. X0 has special handling
.. Reading {X1, X0} will read all zeros
.. Writing {X1, X0} will discard the entire result, it will not write to X1

Note that *Zp64* from the P-extension specifies consistent register pair handling.

Big endian mode is enabled in M-mode if `mstatus.MBE`=1, in S-mode if `mstatus.SBE`=1, or in U-mode if `mstatus.UBE`=1

The register pairs are only used by the floating point arithmetic instructions. All integer loads and stores will only access `XLEN` bits, not `FLEN`.

`FLW` on a `RV32D` core will NaN-box and so load a 64-bit value in an `F` register. On a `RV32D Zfinx` core `FLW` is not implemented, and the behaviour of `LW` is clearly specified to write a single `X` register. For strict compatibility with `FLW` software should use `LW` to load the even numbered register, and write all 1’s to the odd numbered register in the pair to NaN-box the result. _This is unlikely to be required, and the compiler will not do this._

[[x0-register-target]]
= x0 register target

If a floating point instruction targets x0 then it will still execute, and will set flags in `fcsr` (if required). It will not write to a target register. This matches the non-Zfinx behaviour for

`fcvt.w.s x0, f0`

If the floating point source is invalid then it will set the `fflags.NV` bit, regardless of whether `Zfinx` is implemented. The target register is not written as it is x0.

If `fcsr.RM` is in an illegal state then floating point instruction behaviour is the same whether the target register is x0 is not, i.e. targetting x0 doesn't disable any execution side effects.

In the case of `RV32D Zfinx`, register pairs are used. See above for x0 handling.

[[nan-boxing]]
= NaN-boxing

NaN-boxing is used when a floating point value is written which is smaller than the width of the target register. For example, writing a half-precision value into a 32-bit register (e.g. `RV32F Zfh` ) or writing a 32-bit value into a 64-bit register (e.g. `RV64F`). All upper bits are written with 1s. Therefore if the register is read by a floating point instruction which reads a value wider than the one which wrote the result, the value is interpreted as a NaN to indicate that an error has occurred.

NaN-boxing also simplifies context save/restore as the software does not need to know the precision of the value stored in the floating point registers.

NaN boxing is useful in cases where it is unknown whether floating point data will be interpreted as the full width of the register, or as a shorter value. 
For example for `RV32F Zfh Zfinx` when a half-precision value is passed as a function argument, 
the callee may not know if it is to be interpreted as a 32-bit or 16-bit value. 
Therefore if the callee misinterprets the value as 32-bit then the 
NaN-boxing ensures that the value is interpreted as a NaN, so the software should detect this and return an error.

For `Zfinx` the NaN-boxing is limited to `XLEN` bits, not `FLEN` bits. Therefore a `FADD.S` executed on an `RV64D` core will write a 64-bit value (the MSH will be all 1’s). On an `RV32D Zfinx` core it will write a 32-bit register, i.e. a single X register only. This means there is semantic difference between these code sequences:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
#ifdef __riscv_zfinx

fadd.s x2, x3, x4 # only write x2 (32-bits), x3 is not written

#else

fadd.s f2, f3, f4 # NaN-box 64-bit f2 register to 64-bits

#endif
----

NaN-box generation is supported by `Zfinx` implementations. NaN-box checking is not supported by scalar floating point instructions. For example for `RV64F`:

[source,sourceCode,text]
----
#ifdef __riscv_zfinx

lw[u] x1, 0(sp)   # load 32-bits into x1 and sign / zero extend upper 32-bits
fadd.s x1, x1, x1 # use x1 but do not check source is Nan-boxed, NaN-box output

#else

flw.s  f1, 0(sp)  # load 32-bits into f1 and NaN-box to 64-bits (set upper 32-bits to 0xFFFFFFFF)
fadd.s f2, f1, f1 # check f1 is NaN-boxed, NaN-box output

#endif
----

Floating point loads are not supported on `Zfinx` cores so x1 is not NaN-boxed in the example above, therefore the `FADD.S` instruction does _not_ check the input for NaN-boxing.
The result of `FADD.S` _is_ NaN-boxed, which means setting the upper half of the output register to all 1's.

The table shows the effect of writing each possible width of value to the register file for all supported combinations. Note that Verilog syntax is used in the final column.

|32 |64 a|
Odd Xreg: result[31:0]

EvenXreg: result[63:32]

|=======================================================================

Therefore, for example, if a `FADD.S` instruction is issued on a `RV64F` core then the upper 32-bits will be set to one in the target integer register, or an `FADD.H` (floating point add half-word) instruction will set the upper 48-bits to one.

[[assembly-syntax-and-code-porting]]
= Assembly Syntax and Code Porting

The assembly syntax is different for `Zfinx` cores so that users are forced to allocate registers correctly. 

. All accesses to `F` registers are illegal. 
. All scalar floating point loads and stores instructions are removed from the architecture
. All integer / floating point move isntructions are removed from the architecture

Therefore any references to `F` registers, or removed instructions will cause assembler errors.

For example, the encoding for

`FMADD.S <1>, <2>, <3>, <4>`

will disassemble and execute as

`FMADD.S f1, f2, f3, f4`

on a non-Zfinx core, or

`FMADD.S x1, x2, x3, x4`

on a `Zfinx` core.


_We considered allowing pseudo-instructions for the deleted instructions for easier code porting. For example allowing FLW to be a pseudo-instruction for LW, but decided not to. Because the register specifiers must change to integer registers, it makes sense to also remove the use of FLW etc. In this way the user is forced to rewrite their code for a `Zfinx` core, reducing the chance of undiscovered porting bugs. This only affects assembly code, high level language code is unaffected as the compiler will target the correct architecture._

[[replaced-instructions]]
= Replaced Instructions

All floating point loads, stores and floating point to integer moves are removed on a `Zfinx` core. The following three tables give suggested replacements.

|=========================================================================================================================

Notes:

. Where a floating point load loads fewer than `XLEN` bits then software NaN-boxing in software is required to get the same semantics
. Where a floating point move moves fewer than `XLEN` bits then either sign extension (if the target is an `X` register) or NaN-boxing (if the target is an `F` register) is required in software to get the same semantics


The B-extension is useful for sign extending and NaN-boxing.

To sign-extend using the B-extension:

`FMV.X.H rd, rs1`

is replaced by

`SEXT.H rd, rs1`

Without the B-extension two instructions are required: shift left 16 places, then arithmetic shift right 16 places.

NaN boxing in software is more involved, as the upper part of the register must be set to 1. The B-extension is also helpful in this case. 

`FMV.H.X a0, a1`

is replaced by

`C.ADDI a2, zero, -1`

`PACK a0, a1, a2`



[[rationale]]
= Rationale, why implement Zfinx?

Small embedded cores which need to implement floating point extensions have some options:

.  Software emulation of floating point instructions (minimum core area)

..  The floating point library can be large, and expensive in terms of ROM or flash storage, costing power and energy consumption

..  The performance of this solution is very low

..  The area of the core is low

.  Low core area floating point implementations

..  Share the integer registers for floating point instructions (Zfinx)

...  Will cause more register spills/fills than having a separate register file, but the effect of this is application dependant

...  No need for special instructions such as load and stores to access floating point registers, and moves between integer and floating point registers

..  There are still performance/area tradeoffs to make for the FPU design itself

... e.g. pipelined versus iterative

..  Optionally remove multiply-add instructions to save area in the FPU and a register file read port

.. Optionally remove divide/square root instructions to to save area in the FPU

. Typically higher area, higher performance

.. Separate floating point registers allow fewer register spills/fills, and can also be used for integer code to prevent spilling to memory

.. There are the same performance/area tradeoffs for the FPU design

Zfinx is implemented to allow core area reduction as the area of the `F` register file is significant, for example:

. `RV32IF Zfinx` saves 1/2 the register file state compared to `RV32IF`
. `RV32EF Zfinx` saves 2/3 the register file state compared to `RV32EF`

Therefore `Zfinx` should allow for small embedded cores to support floating point with

. Minimal area increase
. Similar context switch time as an integer only core
.. there are no `F` registers to save/restore
. Reduced code size by removing the floating point library


[[heading]]
= Emulation

A non-`Zfinx` core can run a `Zfinx` binary. M-mode software can do this:

. Set `mstatus.fs`=0 to cause every floating point instruction to trap
. When a floating point instruction traps, move the source operands from the X registers to the equivalent F registers (i.e. the same register numbers)
. Set `mstatus.fs` to be non-zero
. Execute the original instruction which caused the trap
. Move the result from the destination `F` register to the `X` register / `X` register pair (For `RV32D`)
. Set `mstatus.fs`=0
. `MRET``

There are corner cases around the use of x0 and register pairs for `RV32D`
. Two 32-bit `X` registers must be transferred to a single 64-bit F register to set up the source operands. This must be done by saving each `X` register to consecutive memory locations, and using a 64-bit floating point load (`FLD` or `C.FLD`) to load the data
. One 64-bit F register must be transferred to two 32-bit `X` registers to receive the result. This must be done with a 64-bit floating point store (`FSD` or `C.FSD`) and then two 32-bit loads (such as `LW` or `C.LW`).
. If the source register pair is {x1,x0}, the source data will read as all zeroes. Therefore f0 must be loaded with a 64-bit zero constant from memory.
. If the destination register pair is {x1,x0} then the full output is discarded, do not transfer the resulting data to the {x1,x0} register pair which would result in the upper half being written to x1

A `Zfinx` core cannot trap on floating point instructions by setting `mstatus.fs`=0, so the reverse emulation isn’t possible. The code must be recompiled (or ported for assembler).


[[abi]]
= ABI

For details of the current calling conventions see:

https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md[_https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md_]
C
The ABI when using `Zfinx` is the standard integer calling convention as listed in the table below.

The `Zfinx` ABI can be thought of as being similar to using the softfloat routines to execute floating point functionality, but replacing the call to the softfloat function with the actual floating point ISA instruction.

Note that `RV32D` `Zfinx` requires register pair handling. This does not require an ABI change as long types are already supported using register pairs. It is likely to require some work in the compiler (according to Jim Wilson).

[[fp_configs]]
= Floating Point Configurations To Reduce Area

To reduce the area overhead of FPU hardware new configurations will make the `F[N]MADD.\*, F[N]MSUB.*` and `FDIV.\*, FSQRT.*`` instructions optional in hardware. This then gives the choice of implementing them in software instead by:

. Taking an illegal instruction trap, and calling the required software routine in the trap handler. This requires that the opcodes are not reallocated and gives binary compatibility between cores with/without hardware support for `F[N]MADD.\*, F[N]MSUB.*` and `FDIV.\*, FSQRT.*`, but is lower performance than option 2

. Use the GCC options below so that a software library is used to execute them

This argument already exists for RISCV

`gcc -mno-fdiv`

This argument exists for other architectures (e.g. MIPs) but not for RISCV, so it needs to be added

`gcc -mno-fused-madd`

To achieve this we break all current and future floating point extensions into three parts: `Zf*base`, `Zfma` and `Zfdiv`. `Zfinx` is orthogonal, and so is an additional modifier to these as described below.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|============================================================
|Options, all start with *Zf* |Meaning
|Zfhbase |Support half precision base instructions
|Zffbase |Support single precision base instructions
|Zfdbase |Support double precision base instructions
|Zfqbase |Support quad precision base instructions
|Zfldstmv|Support load,store and integer to/from FP move for all FP extensions
|Zfma    |Support multiply-add for all FP extensions
|Zfdiv   |Support div/sqrt for all FP extensions
|Zfinx   |Share the integer register file for all FP extensions
|============================================================

So the `Zfldstmv`, `Zfma`, `Zfdiv`, `Zfinx` options apply to all floating point extensions, including future ones. This keeps the support regular across the different options.

Therefore `RV32FD Zfh Zfinx` can also be expressed as:

`rv32_Zfhbase_Zffbase_Zfdbase_Zfma_Zfdiv_Zfinx`

Also `RV32FD Zfh` can be expressed as:

`rv32_Zfhbase_Zffbase_Zfdbase_Zfldstmv_Zfma_Zfdiv`

The options are designed to be additive, none of them remove instructions.
